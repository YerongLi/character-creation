(…)
M1: I came over there about 10:00 =
P1: = do you know what time you left 
(…)
M1: I left shortly after she gave me the key =
P1: = so you’re telling me you got there at 9:00 something 
(.)
M1: I’m thinking that 30 or something maybe =
P1: = did you go in the house 
(.)
M1: mm =
P1: = did you go in the house =
M1: = yes she can see she opened the door let me in =
P1: = okay (.) did you be there for 5 minutes 10 minutes 30 minutes 45 minutes =
M1: = I don’t know (…) um about 15-20 minutes 
(.)
P1: did you guys argue =
M1: = no
(.)
P1: there was no argument between you two =
M1: = no she she gave me the key =
P1: = and then you left =
M1: = because she know where my car is if you know my car I had to put it in the shop and get onto my car was there she gave me the charger key I asked her you got the charger key 
(…)
P1: when you left did you go straight home =

M1: = well I was home =
P1: = for an hour 5 minutes 10 minutes 
(.)
M1: about (.) 30 35 45 minutes

M1: = at my house =
P1: = before you got there so you’re telling me you were probably at your house at about 10:15
(.)
M1: mm that could be =
P1: = and I know that that’s not true (…) I know (.) what time you got to your house Danny and it wasn’t after 9:00 =
M1: = I don’t I don’t know the exact times = 
P1: = you’re not even = 
M1: = you’re asking me =

(.)
M1: I went over there to get the charger key charger key to get into my car man
(…) 
P1: okay (.) I’m not saying you didn’t get your charger key but I’m telling you that you went over there for any 20 minutes (.) you were over there for some time (.) and you were the only one who went over there (.) because nobody else came into that house (.) and I know this for a fact I’m not gonna lay out my whole case but you know how I know =
M1: = I I already know who was over her house she told me that her friend D =
P1: = her friend D left (.) about 7 o’clock that night probably about 7:15 so by that time frame she was gone (.) so I’m giving you a chance this is your chance Danny if you want to look like a monster and a cold-blooder killer and that’s what you’re gonna look like but if you came over there and things just went wrong (.) and (.) it was an accident or you lost your temper or it was a mistake then now it’s the time for you to tell me but if you want to stick to the fact that (.) we’re crazy and all this evidence I have is bullshit you’re gonna look terrible (.) look people understand when people screw up or make a mistake =
M1: = I didn’t make a mistake because I know I didn’t do this (.) I’ll put my right hand to god I didn’t do this

M1: = I’m not worried about it =
P1: = well okay you should be worried =
M1: = I’m not gonna be worried about other people =
P1: = you should be worried because I’m telling you right now you’re gonna look like you went over there with a sole purpose to kill her and I know that things were rough with you guys and I know that they were up and down and I know that this isn’t totally your fault I know that she had she was still talking to you and I think you’re probably thinking that she’s leading you on (.) but I’m telling you right now if you stick to this you’re gonna look like a cold-blooded murderer and that’s what you’re gonna look like (…) all this evidence right here is is you if you flip them out right in here these are all disks (.) surveillance desks (.) stuff I pulled out off your car desk uh things that I pulled off of (.) your phone things I pulled off of your Facebook I’ve been pretty busy the last couple months okay and I’m not gonna step to you if I don’t know what I’m doing
