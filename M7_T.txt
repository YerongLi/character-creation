P2: = hi there how are you doing
(.)
M7: good =
P2: = okay

[inaudible]
P1: so as we have briefly discussed over at the jail (.) um (.) I did listen to your interview yesterday 
(.)
M7: mhm =
P1: = that you had with detective * a couple days ago (.) and um (.) and I do appreciate that you wanted to come here and talk about what what happened because of really (.) not only it helps the family but (.) it seems like it’s all quite a bit to get it off your chest (.) so that’s that’s the advantage for both of us I think (.) uh the reason I wanted to talk to you though is because after we listened to the interview there’s just some things that we wanted to address and it’s not um it’s not because um they wanted to talk to you about this but because they didn’t know the whole case when you came in and basically gave you an information about what happened and they they didn’t know any history of this so um because we worked so hard since this occurred and we have a lot more information about the incident itself that that was never addressed yet the other nights and that’s why we came down and wanted to talk to you 
(.)
M7: alright =
P1: = okay (…) um during the interview though um you gave them um a handwritten note did you intend it to send to us
(.)
M7: yeah
(…)
P1: does that look familiar to you =
M7: = yeah =
P1: = is that the note that you wrote =
M7: = yes =
P1: = so you drafted it in your own handwriting =
M7: = yeah =
P1: = okay and it was intended for us to have 
(.)
M7: for the family yeah =
P1: = oh for the family 
(.)
M7: and for you guys yeah =
P1: = okay I just wanted to know I wanted to confirm that that you wrote that and signed your name to it
(…)
M7: yeah
(.)
P1: okay and it looks like you wrote that (…) on the 17th (…) is that right (.) 12-10 days ago 
(.)
M7: I actually don’t the date but yeah =
P1: = okay (…) so uh um if it’s okay with you (.) um (…) I’m gonna start by just kind of recapping what you talked about the other day (.) is that okay
(…)
M7: oh =
P1: = in no in no reason I want to do this it’s just want to make sure I want I wanna be clear it’s the type I’m kind of person you know um that that’s you know what you intended (.) to (.) to talk about is that is that okay with you =
M7: = sure =
P1: = okay (.) so um during the interview you discussed um leaving Utah (.) um and flying over to Portland
(.)
M7: that’s correct 
(.)
P1: okay that’s towards middle of August that you flew there

(.)
P1: okay = 
P2: = has he ( seen ) Miranda =
P1: = what’s that
(.)
P2: has he seen Miranda 
(…)
P1: uh we haven’t read your rights correct 
(.)
M7: uh 
(.)
P1: do you remember your rights
(.)
M7: that I have the right to remain silent (.) and I have the right to be represented by an attorney =
P1: = okay 
(.)
M7: and if I can’t afford it one will be appointed for me
(…)
P1: you’ve got two full things (.) I know you read your right the other day can I (( M7 coughs )) I know you remember your rights (.) correct =
M7: = ( yeah ) =
P1: = I’m going to read them to you again =
M7: = alright =
P1: = just for clarification okay (…) you have the right to remain silent anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law you have the right to talk to an attorney and have him present while you’re being questioned (.) if you cannot afford to hire an attorney one will be appointed to represent you before and during any questioning if you wish (.) you can decide at any time to exercise your rights and not answer any questions or make any statements if you wish to answer questions now without an attorney present you can stop answering those questions at any time
(.)
M7: mhm =

P1: = okay (.) how long did you intend to stay with them
(…)
M7: I don’t know (.) indefinitely or (.) I don’t know
(.)
P1: you just kind of
(.)
M7: I [ [inaudible]
P1: 	 [ [inaudible] residency that to stay there 
(.)
M7: more or less (.) but then (.) I (.) I don’t know I don’t seem to like get along with a lot of people apparently for a very long periods of time so I would just go back home (.) and they dropped me off by it’s where train goes by (.) and I was trying to jump on a train that went by but it was too fast every time there was no way I could jump on that train
(( P1 laughs ))
P1: okay (.) so um did you did you have like uh um a disagreement with them or something or why did you leave that house soon and go (…) go down there and stay in the shop [ that was by shed =
M7:                                                      [ yep it was by the shed it wasn’t it wasn’t a disagreement it was me like I have a difficult time getting along with people so I told him I had to leave (.) and there were like fine with that no problem with that and I was just gonna get on [inaudible] =
P1: = so you just left on foot then 
(.)
M7: they dropped me off by a train (.) by where the train goes by the river by the river =
P1: = okay (.) did you have a uh were you on foot or did you have a bicycle or =
M7: = on foot =
P1: = did you have a bicycle had you ever had a bicycle 
(.)
M7: mm 
(.)
P1: okay (.) any other transportation other than by foot 
(…)
M7: no (.) not until I’d stoled Mr Bushey’s car =
P1: = okay (.) so they dropped you off by the train you recall (.) and um (…) and you say you walked from there (.) how far do you think you walked (.) did you walk for a couple days or (.) or was it the same day you found the shop 
(.)
M7: I think it was like 2 days =
P1: = okay where did you sleep for these 2 days 
(.)
M7: in the bushes by the river 
(.)
P1: okay (…) so um when you left the river then to go and ultimately ended up in a Bushey’s property (.) how what what took you there 
(.)
M7: I got (.) I was smoking cocaine with this guy I got off paranoid that he was going to beat me up 
(.)
P1: do you remember who that was 
(.)
M7: I don’t =
P1: = okay (.) just some guy by the river =
M7: = yeah =
P1: = okay (.) so um you left him then and then just happened upon (.) this property 
(.)
M7: I was running running through bushes I don’t know I thought like all the sudden he and a bunch of people were chasing me up like I was really paranoid like that they’re going to attack me or something =
P1: = mhm =
M7: = so I was just running through all these bushes (.) and then I stopped some and were to listen and laid there for a long time (…) seems like it (.) would not have been like overnight all the way overnight (…) but I then I got up and started walking again (…) mm (.) that’s (.) when I got to at that that shop 
(.)
P1: so you talked about a big shop a big shed like shop =
M7: = mhm =
P1: = and then you you talked about a house in a travel trailer =
M7: = mhm =
P1: = and a big box fan truck kind of a thing and then uh a red car =
M7: = mhm 
(.)
P1: now correct me if I’m wrong but you had mentioned I think during the interview that you had entered a shop the shop the big metal shop first 
(.)
M7: it wasn’t metal (.) wood shop (.) I think it was made of wood =
P1: = could have been metal or you just don’t remember 
(…)
M7: maybe could have been but I don’t think it was 
(…)
P1: so um it was a pretty good-sized right =
M7: = mhm =
P1: = pretty big okay (.) um (.) and what did you do inside the shop there 
(.)
M7: as (.) I walked around look at some stuff and then I was gonna steal some stuff out of there so I stopped I put the [inaudible] by the sliding door =
P1: = aha =
M7: = and then uh (…) um (…) and that’s it that’s all I did when I was in there =
P1: = so if I showed you because =
P2: = I just have a quick clarifying question (.) how did you get into the shop 
(.)
M7: I think through the site through a site like there was a site like there was a door that you could slide out a little bit or some =
P2: = was it unlocked =
M7: = I think without a lock I think that was um I honestly don’t remember I don’t think it was unlocked 
(…)
P1: so if I show you a picture of the shop do you think you’d recognise it 
(.)
M7: more likely I would imagine if I look at it 
(…)
P1: did was there any uh did was any a refrigeration in there (.) any =
M7: = not that I know of =
P1: = fridge freezer or anything like that =
M7: = no not that I know of =
P1: = okay (.) but you said that there was some other property in there what kind of property 
(.)
M7: like all kinds of camping equipment and shop equipment and like tools and things like that =
P1: = was that’s when you got his tools that you ended up taking eventually =
M7: = yeah =
P1: = in the truck and eventually so the welder and one more skill saws you decided power saws or something 
(.)
M7: and the what =
P1: = power saws or skills saws or something that you seem you took those too
(.)
M7: it seems like I took power saws but I don’t remember where they were =
P1: = but that’s where they came from was the shop 
(…)
M7: yeah
(.)
P1: uh and you stayed there for
(…)
M7: I don’t know maybe 2 or 3 days =
P1: = okay (.) at what point did you finally decide to decide to go if you’ve ever been in that shop you kind of knew that someone will stay in that travel trailer then (.) because it was close by it was only (.) 30-40 yards away maybe 
(.)
M7: mhm 
(.)
P1: is that alright (.) so you knew someone was coming and going from the travel trailer 
(.)
M7: I didn’t know that they were there at the time
