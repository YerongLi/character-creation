F7: = I didn’t even see the sippy cup = 
P1: = okay (.) do you remember it being in her in her bedroom that sippy cup 
(…)
F7: I think I might have found the sippy cup on the way to (…) I don’t I’m not sure I just remember I believe putting the sippy cup in her bed with her =
P1: = okay (.) did you put anything in the sippy cup = 
F7: = no there was red liquid in it and I know we had Huggies (.) [ I don’t know [inaudible]
P1: [ yeah I remember seeing some Huggies in there =
F7: = to my to be more specific happy drink Huggies = 
P1: is that what they’re called =

F7: = yes = 
P1: = you did = 
F7: = mhm =
P1: = okay (.) was that the same sippy cup that you put the liquid in was it before you went to school when you got home from school or 
(…)
F7: I put a a different juice drink in there and she had a complete fit and she didn’t drink it = 
P1: = okay =
F7: = so how the red liquid got in he changed her sippy cup when he fed her = 
P1: = okay = 
F7: = he said she drank a little bit a:nd threw it =
P1: = okay out of that sippy cup = 
F7: = mhm = 
P1: = okay um (…) when you (.) lived at that address um (.) did you get anything delivered in the mail from overseas 
(.)
F7: I had just ordered (.) her entire room from Walmart I don’t know if that came from overseas or not =
P1: = well Walmart wouldn’t I’m saying did you order anything that maybe (.) that you know that might not have that might have been out of the ordinary any type of (.) anything from a different country =
F7: = no my mother purchased the baby gate that was in her room = 
P1: = okay = 
F7: = but I believe she purchased that from Walmart also = 
P1: = there would be no reason like you would get any packages say from China or from Japan or anything like that 
(.)
F7: like directly from them = 
P1: = yeah 
(.)
F7: I don’t think so = 
P1: = okay but to your knowledge you = 
F7: = I ordered everything from Walmart =
P1: = okay (.) okay (.) um (.) so just to be clear (.) the stuff that was in that sippy cup you did put in or you did not
(.)
F7: I did not = 
P1: = okay (.) okay do you have any idea (.) um (…) well let me I’m just gonna kinda I’m just gonna be blunt to you (.) your child (.) died from (.) um Fentanyl poisoning 
(…) 	
F7: so why does see why have told me hypoxic cardiac arrest = 
P1: = they there weren’t lab results then so I’m gonna explain this to you okay (…) in that sippy cup was Fentanyl (.) in her blood was Fentanyl we just got these results back (.) it’s the same type of Fentanyl that people are overdosing every day in Pittsburgh and dying from same exact type (.) okay (.) so I need to know how the Fentanyl got in the sippy cup (.) because right now it’s not an accident (…) okay 
(.)
F7: mhm 
(…)
P1: alright so scientifically it’s impossible for your daughter to put Fentanyl in a sippy cup (.) okay physically it’s impossible for her to do scientifically that’s another story but right now that’s what that’s how she died (.) it wasn’t a heart attack it wasn’t (.) any other reason other than she overdosed on Fentanyl which is the same Fentanyl that people in the streets are dying of every single day (.) how the Fentanyl get in the sippy cup Jhenea
(.)
F7: just straight Fentanyl = 
P1: = yeah
(.)
F7: so what is it like a liquid a a a = 
P1: = I’m not a scientist it comes in a liquid form it comes in a powder form I’m not exactly sure but what I am sure of is that that Fentanyl was put in a sippy cup and there was liquid mixed into it and it was given to Charlette and that’s how she died (…) so I need to know how that got in there = 
F7: = I have no knowledge to how Fentanyl got in my daughter’s sippy cup
(.)
P1: okay (.) cause you realise right now this investigation’s taken a whole different turn =
F7: = yeah clearly
(.)
P1: and when someone gives someone something and they die from it (.) it’s a homicide (.) she was poisoned intentionally =
F7: = okay well =
P1 = okay =
F7: = I’ve been making complaints to my rent office because I’ve been smelling a funny smell in my house uh several times returning back to my house
(…)
P1: this is since you’ve moved or = 
F7: = no this is living in * = 
P1: = this is where you used to live [ [inaudible]
F7: 							  [ yes = 
P1: = okay (.) well (.) that still wouldn’t explain how it got in the sippy cup
(.)
F7: well I’m just as clueless as you are (.) so are you implicating that I put Fentanyl in my child’s sippy cup = 
P1: = NO I I but based on this timeline there’s only two people that could have put Fentanyl in the sippy cup (.) based on what you just told me about 10 minutes ago (.) and based on the whole timeline of that day (…) I need to know how it got in there cause this investigation is not going away = 
F7: = okay and I’m telling you I returned to my house from being picked up from school =
P1: = mhm =
F7: = and I did nothing out of the usual =
P1: = okay =
F7: = we took our stuff off and she ran around and played and I’m waiting for my social worker to come =
P1: = okay (.) do you get Fentanyl delivered from China = 
F7: = I have I know I don’t know anything about Fentanyl =
P1: = okay (.) did you ever put anything in her sippy cup other than (.) [ Huggie juice
F7: = 		[ no	she’s drank water she’s drank milk she’s drank Kool-Aid liquids = 
P1: = but have you ever put anything in there = 
F7: = no I have not = 
P1: = okay
F7: = other than = 
P1: = I mean cause some parents will give their kids a little bit of Benadryl or something like that so they can = 
F7: = no that doesn’t go in the sippy cup because it’s supposed to be measured out and Benadryl’s not supposed to be drank Tylenol’s not supposed to be drank over a specific amount of hours it’s supposed to be one dose and that’s it = 
P1: = right I agree with you I agree with you but people parents = 
F7: = I’m not one of those [ people or parents 
P1: 					  [ okay okay that’s what I’m asking and it wouldn’t be the first time okay I’m just asking but the problem we have a problem right now would you is that safe to say that there’s a problem (…) I mean I have a I have I have to figure out how this got in there because your baby is can’t tell me (…) is there a reason someone would want to do that with some is there a reason why Fentanyl would be in a sippy cup =
F7: = no there’s not and no there’s not a reason anybody would want to 
(…) 
P1: the amount of Fentanyl that was in her system was extremely high (…) okay it was it was very high and that’s essentially when she drank the sippy cup whenever she picked that sippy cup off the bed it was absorbed very quickly and once she swallowed it she didn’t have much time to survive
(.)
F7: that’s not possible because I didn’t physically see her with her sippy cup and we were at um I was with her I can’t tell you the exact time frame (.) but when I got home =
P1: = mhm = 
F7: cause I went to the welfare office a little bit after I as soon as I left school (.) there’s no possible way 
(.)
P1: well that sippy cup I showed you that picture of that’s the sippy cup that had it in it (…) okay (.) I’m gonna step out for a little bit and let you think about this = 
F7: = there’s nothing to think about = 
P1: = okay well I need to step out anyway alright (.) but I but that’s why I brought you here to tell you exactly what happened (.) and what we’ve found and I mean it wasn’t really me but it was you know the scientists and you know people at the lab who discovered all this medical examiners doctors (…) okay = 
F7: = okay so (…) am I under arrest = 
P1: = no = 
F7: = are there any more questions 
(.) 
P1: I just wanna know how it got in there that’s the big question = 
F7: = I don’t know how it got in there (…) this is news to me like it’s news to you = 
P1: = if you had to guess (.) how it got in there (.) is there any way you know any guess (.) you could have = 
F7: = a manufacturing issue with the Happy Drinks 
(.) 
P1: so you think it could’ve been the the Huggie = 
F7: = yes and as a matter of fact I took a sip of those Huggies and I actually (.) it didn’t really have a uh a  pleasing taste to it =
P1: = we tested the Huggies = 
F7: = mhm 
(.) 
P1: no Fentanyl
(.)
F7: so what are you implying = 
P1: = I’m I’m I’m asking I’m just asking straight up how it got in there = 
F7: = and I’m telling you straight up I have no clue how it got in there = 
P1: = no clue (.) is this something your boyfriend would have done = 
F7: = he has kids of his own why would he hurt my child = 
P1: = I don’t know well there’s I mean there’s did anyone else have access to the apartment = 
F7: = maintenance people the people who run the place = 
P1: = so other than the maintenance people and people who run the place the only person who has access to it is you and um (.) Mr * 
(.)
F7: yes
(…)
P1: was any maintenance people in there recently = 
F7: = I wouldn’t know =
P1: = you wouldn’t know (…) does anyone was anyone in your house that uses heroin
(.) 
F7: I wouldn’t know what peoples person drugs they use = 
P1: = but to your knowledge 
(.)
F7: no = 
P1: = did you have any people in your house that use heroin =
F7: = no =
P1: = do you use heroin = 
F7: = no = 
P1: = does your boyfriend use heroin = 
F7: = no

P1: other than smoking weed do you do any other drugs = 
F7: = no
