M3: = like I said I have known her obviously since she’s worked she start since she started working there um (…) I would say probably about 8 months ago or so we started hanging out outside of work (.) um (.) and at the time I had a girlfriend (.) um but we kind of you know we kind of connected me and Savvanah so we hung out a little bit here and there um got pretty close uh we come from I guess somewhat similar (.) um backgrounds I guess you should say =
P1: = okay =
M3: = um you know she didn’t have it the best growing up neither did I so we kind of connected hung out for a while probably would say a period of (…) 2-3 months =
P1: = okay =
M3: = um and then um she started using drugs a lot now I used them with her not the same drugs that she used all the time um but I did them with her a couple times and then she started to get (.) heavy into them and = 
P1: = oh gotcha okay =
M3: = um so um I kind of just uh try to take a step back and you know put things off um a:nd after that um me and my ex (.) started kind of chit chatting again =
P1: = okay and who’s that what’s her name =
M3: = her name’s Chelsea =
P1: = okay alright
(.)
M3: = um so we kind of started chit chatting again never really hundred percent because obviously you know she was still kind of upset about me um hanging out with Savvanah and stuff like that um and then probably (…) a month or so ago =
P1: = mhm 
(.)
M3: um I saw Savvanah again at work and she looked healthy again you know she gained a little bit of weight =
P1: = yeah =
M3: = a:nd uh just you know friendly talk at work you know telling her you know hope everything has been good and she told me you know that I guess she uh she did a lot of drugs and ended up in the hospital she ended up missing like I want to say a couple days three or four days of work =
P1: = oh okay =
M3: = um so obviously you know (.) me being pretty close to her I was concerned and everything but after she came back you know she looked good she ended up telling me that I guess uh you know over those 4 days she detoxed pretty well she kind of caught you know a new sense into why she should do so much drugs =
P1: = good for her okay =
M3: = so much and like I said she looked good she started looking healthy so uh we were kind of talking you know here and there and we hung out a couple times um she came over to the house and we just kind of kicked back drink a couple beers watched movies stuff like that =
P1: = okay =
M3: = um and then as we hung out you know after a couple times she brought drugs over =
P1: = mhm 
(.)
M3: um and I told her you know you’re doing really good you can’t you know you shouldn’t be doing it again you’re finally gaining weight because when we were together the first time she was you know she got really petite =
P1: = okay =
M3: = and just didn’t look well um which is kind of why I took a step back plus (.) uh (…) my father used a lot of drugs growing up my mother used a lot of drugs growing up =
P1: = okay =
M3: = a:nd it was just kind of a hard thing to see you know (.) every time that we hung out =
P1: = okay =
M3: = like I said we did uh like we took some pain pills here and there on occasion but then she started like bringing heroin over and stuff like that that’s you know uh my mom was addicted to methamphetamines when she was when I was younger =
P1: = okay =
M3: = so those hard like hard drugs does kind of scare me a little but so that’s why I stepped back the first time then I felt like she was better you know as we hung out recently um and then she brought drugs over to my house the last time we hung out =
P1: = okay =
M3: = a:nd uh we would text here and there I would ask her how she was doing you know hope her day was going good just because I told her the last time we hung out I was like you know you’re doing really well stop doing this you know you can do it =
P1: = yeah yeah no doubt =
M3: = um a:nd (.) I heard that she kept you know was doing the same thing =
P1: = okay
(.)
M3: = um so we texted a couple times and I end up telling her hey you know uh for one I’m dealing with a lot of personal stuff myself right now as it is I’m a little depressed um but I think we’re moving too fast I think we should you know stop (.) talking =
P1: = okay =
M3: = um and she said I understand it’s completely fine no problem you know uh she said I’ll delete your number I’ll never text you again =
P1: = okay =
M3: = and I said same and I was like I’m sorry like I didn’t mean to you know try to jump back into things I just I think we moved too fast um and I said I wouldn’t text her either just to be you know kind of split =
