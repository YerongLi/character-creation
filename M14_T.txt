P1: = why not =
M14: = we pulled into the parking lot then I pulled the weapon on him and demanded that he take me to Asher sir =
P1: = okay and why did you all of a sudden decided that you need to go to Asher 
(…)
M14: because I was planning to take him out into the country and kill him 
(.) 
P1: okay so (.) when you got him at the dorm was your intention to never go to Walmart =
M14: = yes sir 
(.)
P1: you were in fact was at that point already in your mind that you gonna take him and kill him =
M14: = yes sir 
(.)
P1: um had he done something to you =
M14: = no sir
(.)
P1: okay so you just (.) but did you can’t tell me when you made this decision that you’re going to take him and kill him why 
(.)
M14: I made decision three days prior to the incident attempted it two days prior to the incident but he was not in his room and did so today as he was in his room =
P1: = okay so you’ve been you’ve been planning this for two days =
M14: = uh two weeks =
P1: = two weeks =
M14: = but not at that sorted individual =
P1: = and when did you get to the point where you knew you were going to beat him =
M14: = that was three days prior to the incident =
P1: = a:nd why him =
M14: = um =
P1: = all the kids in college or one 
(.)
M14: I believed that he would have had the least impact sir = 
P1: = impact of what
(.)
M14: um I believed he didn’t have many friends or many close friends I should rephrase and as he’s as he is going missing his essence would be less notable 
(.)
P1: okay so what about if tomorrow school nobody thought anything of it =
M14: uh that was the plan sir yes = 
P1: = okay (.) and so why did you choose to take him to Asher to kill him when =
M14: = um my plan was that after my killing him I was going to head north towards  Canada and Asher was further north than Ada so =
P1: = okay =
M14: = and I I know the surrounding terrain and I knew a good spot I didn’t have that spot planned in particular if I had planned that for or what kind of a great dock but (.) I knew a general area =
P1: = okay so you’d rather do that here because you knew that very good because your family is there =
M14: = yes sir =
P1: = and that’s around that you would travel going back home to your mom and dad’s house =
M14: = uhh no sir I travel the road further to the south of it just the road that’s more south to it that’s the way I would travel going to my mother’s house from the school on my bus sir =
P1: = but what I’m saying you’re familiar with that road =
M14: = yes sir =
P1: = and where it would go to =
M14: = yes sir =
P1: = not much traffic on that road at this time that =
M14: = yes sir =
P1: = I mean =
M14: = the only people that go on that road are those that live right there sir =
P1: = and you knew that =
M14: = yes sir =
P1: = okay so when you pointed the gun at Walmart in the parking lot =
M14: = yes sir =
P1: = um what did you tell him =
M14: = I told him to take me to (.) that Asher =
P1: = Asher and did he say anything =
M14: = uh he panicked uh at one point he picked his phone I pulled his phone out of his hand and then he ( cried some more ) kept telling me not to kill him to make him feel more comfortable I unloaded the clip I loaded the bullet from the chamber and then handed over to him and that eased his nerves a little then I pulled a second clip out of my pocket and set it on my lap 
(.)
P1: okay (.) and you drove him to and he drove you =
M14: = yes sir =
P1: = and did you have any conversation between Ada and Asher = 
M14: = the entire time there was a conversation sir =
P1: = and what was it about can you tell me what the conversation was =
M14: = um about (.) from Ada to half-way to Asher was my trying to reaffirm him that I wasn’t going to kill him to calm his nerves and then from that point on we was talking on our upbringings our past our family histories uh things of a philosophical nature etc etc 
(.)
P1: okay (.) and (…) so did he say anything you had him before off of the main highway under this dirt road =
M14: = no sir =
P1: = okay =
M14: = uh before this time I had pulled out his phone and pulled out his DPS and showed him where I lived to make him feel more comfortable sir =
P1: = okay and so when you turned to the last stop at 177 there’s we’ve already talked about there’s a substation there =
M14: = we didn’t pull onto that road sir we pulled on the directed south of it drove past Turkey Hill One Road turned left I went to around where the [inaudible] lived made another left past like estates went straight and then went down that road from the other direction =
P1: = so you came in from the west side (.) of where the pickup was left =
M14: = that’s west heading east yes =
P1: = okay and (.) so you’re headed east um well there’s another substation road which is the road with a pickup =
M14: = yes sir =
P1: = is at now =
M14: = yes sir 
(.)
P1: um so you headed east and he was driving =
M14: = yes =
P1: = you’re on the passenger side he’s got two bullets that you gave him =
M14: = yeah he had clipped in one round yes =
P1: = okay and where was it at =
M14: = in his left hand sir =
P1: = then you had the gun =
M14: = yes sir =
P1: = and what kind of gun was it =
M14: = uh Springfield Armory XT Phony Smith and Wesson 40 calibre
(.)
P1: okay (.) and you had the gun and another magazine but you didn’t have the magazine in the gun =
M14: I did not have the magazine in the gun every five to 10 minutes he had me put my finger in the hole where the clip goes and showed that the round it wasn’t chambered
(.)
P1: okay and you were driving east and I guess at some point (.) did you say it was now was the time =
M14: = yes sir =
P1: = okay and what happened =
M14: = uh I loaded the gun quickly chambered around quickly shot once missed shot a second time it jumped out of the car went around he was driving 10-15 miles an hour so it was rather slow and around the hood of the car and of course it was slow he wasn’t purposefully driving uh trying to pull one out couldn’t get him out until he already had hit the tree pulling out there dumped him into the no before I dumped him into the ditch I heard him gurgling I’m not sure if that was psychological physical process after death but I thought he might have still lived through that somehow because he was gurgling so I shot him again and then shut him down in the ditch I didn’t get his phone = 
P1: = okay hold on let’s back up just a second =
M14: = yes sir =
P1: = uh you fired first round and you missed =
M14: = yes sir =
P1: = do you know where that around hit =
M14: = it immediately hit the top of the door but it might have hit the top of the window =
P1: = did the window bust =
M14: = the window did bust sir but I don’t remember that was the first through the second round =
P1: = okay so you thought that you missed =
M14: = yes sir =
P1: = and you fired a second round =
M14: = yes sir =
P1: = and did you hit him then =
M14: = yes sir =
P1: = and you hit him in the head =
M14: = in the side of the head yes sir =
P1: = so it would have been nearly right here =
M14: = it was around here sir =
P1: = the right inside of his head =
M14: = yes sir =
P1: = so by the ear =
M14: = yes sir =
P1: = and he was [inaudible] being off the road =
M14: = to the left sir =
P1: = okay and that’s when you got out run around =
M14: = yes sir =
P1: = and you opened the door =
M14: = yes sir
