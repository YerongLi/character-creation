P1: = so this was geared towards Jodie is what you’re telling me =
M10: = yes (.) a:nd as far as I know somebody was supposed to send some people from Chicago (.) some black dudes (…) said it’s not about the money now it’s not about the dope it’s about the principle (.) and he Terry * told me this and I told him I said you better go back and tell them you’re right it’s not about no money it’s not about no [inaudible] but it seems like I’m just fucking around with my fiancée and it pulls me you know what I’m saying that I’m involved (.) and he said sorry too late dude the call’s been made and that uh some people from (.) what’d he say (…) New Orleans or something like that up in Louisiana up here looking for her that’s when I noticed we started being followed and I’m like hold up you know maybe this shit is true I’ve been thinking it’s all you know how people talkin’ just trying to scare somebody (…) and I kept noticing people following me and kept noticing people following me and I’m like hold the fuck up you know (.) so I made a phone call and was like dude (.) what the fucks going on (.) he said man (.) he said I told you I would try to go talk to them I said dude, you already had tried to go talk to them (.) and for the past (…) I don’t know month and a half something like that every time I walked out the door I was being followed (.) and for the life of me nobody believed me and I mean I told everybody I said man somebody is following us somebody is following me or somebody is following you somebody (.) then I got locked up
(…)
P1: what happened with that a little
(.)
M10: that [inaudible cross talk]
P1: I’m not the dope police [inaudible cross talk]
M10: I mean not one time did nobody ever say (.) police nobody said I mean the whole time I told everybody I was being followed I mean I had people run up on me (.) I’d take off nobody ever said cops you know so I don’t know if it’s the cops or if it was them or whoever whatever you know what I’m saying I’m like shit (.) so I’ve done what I do (.) what I know best protect myself and get the hell out of that situation for a moment but that situation it was same thing two cars whipped up on me and then once I took off yeah he hit his lights I’m like I got a set of [inaudible] lights which I do you know what I’m saying I got a flashlight that turns you know what I’m saying you click it one time and it starts flashing you know what I mean red white red blue them lights you know what I’m saying so I’m like no one’s ever said stop police this is the local this is the feds this is whoever you know what I’m saying so I I didn’t stop you know even when we got back to the house we were staying at not one time did anybody say police this is the police the whoever blah blah they just told me to get the fuck down or they would blow my damn brains out I’m like well uh there’s a chance I got to take either they’re the police and then once they started all coming up on me I noticed it was the police because all the equipment and shit like that you know and I was like well maybe this is the cops so I got down
(.)
P1: who all did you get arrested with that night

(.)
M10: I just heard that (.) somebody got shot somebody got killed or something like that you know then we stayed away for a couple days because that’s when I found out that supposedly they were there for her and us you know what I’m saying it was supposed to be us I was like you know um we made the decision to stay away for a couple of days because I mean hell somebody wanted to talk to her they the landlord knew her phone number her cell phone number knew her name everything else nobody ever tried to contact us (…) at least as far as I know nobody ever tried to contact us (.) which I mean the house the apartment wasn’t even =

I don’t believe that there was malicious intent going in I think shit escalated and went bad (.) I told her I wanted to help her try to get to the good side of this and to not paint her into a negative light on it (.) and I said I told her I said I will give you that same opportunity and tell you the same things that I have told you both the exact same things (.) and that’s how I want to present it I don’t bullshit people you know I’ll tell you what I’ve got (.) I mean
