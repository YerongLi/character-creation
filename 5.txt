Devon Jones robbed a money lending business in Reno, pointing a semi-automatic 9mm pistol at an employee, firing a round, and fleeing with cash. Three days later, on January 27, Jones robbed a bank in Carson City. He entered the bank, fired a shot, demanded money from a teller, and fired additional shots before leaving with the stolen cash.
