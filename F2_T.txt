P1: = well when you say people  who are you talking about (.) people that were involved in before or =
F2: = a little bit of everything this was supposed to be something when he got off probation it was supposed to be between us and he went and he told you know friends of his he told you know certain people and everyone kind of talks and he’s constantly running into a lot of the guys that he was on probation with like a couple days ago we ran into someone and that was uh a target I mean you know the guy comes up to us and he’s like with organized crime it seems like the guys from Boca are moving up here and we’re constantly running into you know what I mean a lot of the guys he knows and things like that =

(.)
F2: so it’s a lot of money it was 191,000 dollars =
(( P2 noise of surprise ))
F2: = he had to pay back so we were going to go ahead and he had the money to pay off the probation and everything like that and then I guess somehow when he went away some guys didn’t go away they
(.)
P1: when you say go away you mean went to prison =
F2: = right they left the country and then somehow he was dealing with some of those guys because they thought that he owed them and (.) I don’t know something with that that he was taking care of so the money he used to get off probation he never 
(.)
