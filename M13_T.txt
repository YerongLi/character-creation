M13: = yeah at around 7:00 I think =
P1: = and um so I guess we’re here to talk about what what transpired there 
(.) 
M13: well we were uh were inside talking and uh (.) you know we heard a bang on the door I honestly didn’t know who it was I couldn’t see through the keyhole or the peephole and so uh you know the young man I was with I know has um you know known him for maybe we’ve been talking to come to the coffee shop there I offered a couple times I’ve even had him over at my house played video games before um had no idea he told me when I first met him that he was 20 (.) and uh so when they first got there I I didn’t know what what the issue was um you know um I didn’t know if it was (.) you know somebody was trying to get i:n or what =
P1: = mhm 
(.)
M13: so um you know I asked them if there’s somebody that was from the sheriff’s or someone like that and I said ( hey I’m fine ) and um they’re um they were persistent and then I could finally see a badge on one of them and then they said that there was a minor inside the room um obviously I had no idea when I first this young man he told me he was 20 years old um so like I said we’ve been talking on the phone for a while and in fact for a few months you had told me that he went to California to try to be in the music industry or something um so that was when I opened the door because I mean it just didn’t make any sense to me why you know there’d be a you know police there actually what I asked him was I said are you a minor he said no let me go talk to them and I said okay and um he went out there and that’s you know I don’t know what they talked about but um I asked them to check his ID because again I’ve never even thought to ask him for his ID there’s no reason to (.) um so anyway um I guess after that um um one of the men sergeant something I can’t remember his last name is he’s bald um he’s actually [inaudible] a deal at that point I I was you know again blood pressure um I had to sit down I couldn’t could even I don’t honestly remember what I said to him um a little bit I think (.) and um I just needed to to not have a stroke um so I was caught off guard by that I think they asked me at some point if they could um the room I had my computer back with me and one of them searched my computer bag as well as the room um as far as I know there was nothing found uh so um that was that 
(.)
P1: okay they said that (( clears his throat )) they said that they smelled weed in the in the room did uh were y’all smoking weed or anything =
M13: = we’re not smoking weed =
P1: = was there anything in there =
M13: = no no =
P1: = okay um 
(.)
M13: and again I asked them to search they wanted to search my bag (.) um (.) so I don’t remember I think he I mean he he he needed a place to stay for the night and he had a bag with him I don’t know if this looks bad I did not 
(.)
P1: um so did you stay there all night after the cops left or =
M13: = no I left a little while later =
P1: = what about what time 
(.)
M13: um I have no idea =
P1: = okay (…) but you didn’t stay until in the morning =
M13: = I wanted to make sure that I was okay =
P1: = mhm 
M13: [inaudible]
P1: so you say you how long have you known the guy 
(.)
M13: this was definitely over a year =
P1: = okay what what do you know about him what’s his name you know his last name =
M13: = no (.) um (.) honestly I don’t remember (…) he’s been over at my coffee shop a couple times um he uh I know that he had been arrested for drug dealing in the past =
P1: = mhm 
(.)
M13: uh I know that he had dropped out of high school (.) um you know he was trying to get a GED I was trying to help him through that in fact when we first met I was trying to help him study and things like that for the GED um and then when I lost contact with him for four or five months I guess he when he went to California or whatever um I just assumed that he had you know I didn’t that that’s where he went um
(.)
P1: well how did y’all meet =
M13: = at the coffee shop =

M13: = and um (…) I’m pretty sure that’s how we met I honestly don’t remember um it’s only place I probably would have met this guy (.) so anyway he uh he’s been over a couple of times there um when he came back you know he uh he was in fact he told me he wanted to go to be an anaesthesiologist or something and you know so you’ve got to get you can’t go without a high school diploma you can’t do anything without a high school diploma and so um you know I know that the day after the incident happened he was going to test for the GED I strongly encouraged him to do that um and the night that he called me um he said he just needed to get of his house um I’m assuming I have I thought he had told me that he lived with some friends and um he had told me in the past that you know it was hard for him to get clean because he was always with his friends that that you know living with them um and so you know um when he called and said he needed to get out of there you know that he had the test in the state then the choice was to bring him over to my house which I don’t think my wife would have appreciated that pretty much um but she probably had been okay with this but I just so figured it’d be easier just to get in the place um and then we decided to talk so
(.)
