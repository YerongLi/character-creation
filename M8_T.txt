M8: = okay (.) thank you 
(.)
P1: hello sir =
M8: = hi =
P1: =  my name is sergeant *  
(.)
P2: I’m * 
(.)
M8: I shouldn’t introduce myself because you guys know me =
P1: = oh we know a little bit right (( M8 laughs )) right so a couple things we’ve got some housekeeping items to talk about uh before we start talking about things so we’re gonna read your Miranda rights and your right to a counsellor and then I wanted to talk to you um you know just to let you know where I’m coming from um it sounds like you’ve done a lot of good things um even to this point (.) and so we’re not really concerned about the NBA at this point it’s gonna be finding her okay so uh but before we do that uh you have any questions for me on the concept before I ask you some things (.) uh because I’m gonna advise you about your Miranda rights and your counsellor rights okay mate before we start talking about things at all but as far as questions before we get into that I want all my cards on the table kind of guy and I’m not gonna come here and try to be all tricky or whatever uh detective * is the same way (.) okay =
M8: = well what I’ve got to say is that I want to go home =
P1: = okay =
M8: = but I know it’s impossible to go home =
P1: = yes sir (.) and by home you mean Oregon =
M8: = yes =
P1: = okay because [inaudible crosstalk] we’re working on that as well =
M8: = mhm =
P1: = so that’s what we’re working on uh (.) let’s see here (…) * pull out this =
P2: = yes =
P1: = advice =
P2: = sure (.) um so at this point in time I I do want to let you know that the room is being video recorded it’s also being audio recorded um just for uh the sake of being official today’s date is the 26th of July 2016 I have about 13:12 hours um I’m detective * present with me is detective sergeant * with the Revenue Police Department uh Edwin * and Edwin * alright okay so I want to let you know I’m recording the conversation so that you’re aware of that okay (.) um is there any questions about the (.) this conversation being recorded at all =
M8: = no =
P2: = okay just so you know initially uh (…) we’re gonna ask you some questions about the MVA that stands for the motor vehicle accident all that stuff okay uh before we do so I’m gonna advise you of and read your Miranda right before you get some of the counsellor information section um you do have the right to remain silent anything you say can and will be used against in a court of law you have the right to speak to an attorney and have him or her present with you while you’re being questioned if you can’t afford to hire an attorney one will be appointed before any questioning if you wish okay very important also we’re here to talk to you because we know that um you know we’ve spent the last 16 hours talking to * about finding out stuff about you with your family and those kinds of things I know you’ve got uh a heart that’s probably pretty heavy and you want to tell us some stuff about the vehicle accident and that’s why we’re here okay so it’s important that you hear what I just said to you I want to make sure that you understand uh those rights that I just read to you =
M8: = I do =
P2: = okay sir =
P1: = I also have to read you these are your counsellor rights okay so I’m going to read this directly verbatim um it says that the non-US citizen was being arrested or detained may request and notify your counsellor of your country counsellor officers here in the United States of your situation they also communicate with your counsellor officers a counsellor officer may be able to help you obtain legal representation and then contact your family and visit you in detention among other things if you want us to notify your counsellor’s office you can request this notification now or anytime in the future you want us to notify the counsellor’s officer at this time 
(.)
M8: no =
P1: = okay alright so here’s the thing I just want to get through the nitty-gritty (.) uh we have not been able to find Kaylee’s body can you please uh help me find her body immediately before we start talking about anything else 
(.)
M8: oh 
(.)
P1: the reason why I’m asking you that is uh I’ve done this a bunch of times =
M8: = I want to tell you where the body is =
P1: = yeah =
M8: = I do (.) but I want to get home first =
P1: = okay (.) so here’s what I know about this hear me out sir (.) uh we can’t change what happened none three of us in this room (.) and people will care more about what happens right now than what happened before (.) so uh we know that you’ve been talking to some people etc etc right a:nd (.) because we have different jurisdictions I can assure you that right now the DA’s office is working on allowing us to take you back to Oregon okay but what we’re still working on that okay so in the meantime uh we need to consider some things (.) okay if this information gets to other people that uh you were like oh yeah I’m gonna tell you but only if I get what I want they might uh try to think of this about something different than what it is right (.) and so um what I’ve determined is and we’ve looked at this a bunch of times so I don’t think you’re a bad guy (.) right (.) I think the thins have spun completely out of control sir sir am I right okay what I’ve been said and you know from your training in your education that we have a massive load of resources right now dedicated to one thing and (.) that’s to serve the victim’s family okay and they need that they need that right now (.) and so I need you to remember that it doesn’t matter so much about what happened but is what you do right now =
M8: = I know =
P2: = and you know this =
M8: = can I draw a map =
P2: = a map =

M8: so before (.) can I say the story what happened first =
P1: = yeah as you’re drawing please or whatever whatever you’d like to do (.) sir 
(.)
M8: uh let me do that first =
P1: = do you want us to get you out of that stuff =
M8: = ( I wait for now ) yeah =
P1: = can I ask you to get him out of this stuff so he can draw =
P2: = there won’t be a problem
