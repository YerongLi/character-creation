[inaudible crosstalk] 
(.)
P1: okay you have the right to remain silent do you understand that =
M12: = yes =
P1: = just put the initial right next to one saying that you understood your right to remain silent =

(.)
P2: Jordan that’s my favourite one so do you wanna get if you want to it’s up to you you understand you we’ve got through the question we can ask questions and at any time you don’t like the frame and the training or the questioning rather you can say fuck off and I won’t take no offence to it but I just you know man-to-man I’m just telling you you could say you could say no thanks =
M12 = ( okay guys ) =
P2: = I don’t you know what I’m saying you’ve got the right that’s the one I like the best out of any interview I ever do that’s what I stress the most =
P1: = do you understand each of these rights that I’ve explained to you =
M12: = mhm = 
P1: = yes that’s it make sure =

P1: = nobody’s injured =
M12: = I don’t know =
P1: = so tell me tell us what happened today tell us what happened today =

P1: = mhm 
(.)
M12: uh officer * detective * =
P1: = mhm 
(.)
M12: said that I’m being booked into jail (.) so if I’m going to be booked into jail (.) I mean (.) no matter what then it just doesn’t make any sense for me to answer any questions =
P2: = let me ask you when you were in law enforcement when you talked to you uh you went out on a call or something and you got one one story =
M12: = I understand that but that’s my girlfriend said something and I don’t said what she’d said (.) if somebody you earlier you said that somebody else called them and said something =
P1: = okay and that’s all we’re looking for you that’s all =
P2: = someone must have said something right =
M12: = but but I just I just don’t understand why I’m gonna make a statement if I’m gonna go to jail regardless =
P2: = because it would have happened regardless if you go to jail or not either way either way what happens is and I told this to your father I was at the house talking to him it’s it’s (.) it’s up to you but I have one story or two stories and I don’t have yours your story could put holes in their story and I can and maybe never mind =
M12: = or I could say something that could me = 
P1: = okay only tell me the truth =
M12: = I’ve already said the truth I’ve already told everybody earlier what happened um I you know =
P2: = who did you tell =
M12: = I talked to (.) uh what’s the name 
(.)
P1: the guy you rode with =
M12: = we got first = 
P1: = oh that was detective * the guy wore plain clothes with the black jacket 
(.)
M12: ( no ) I did talk to him over there =
P1: = here’s the thing in the end of the day [inaudible crosstalk] whatever truth is =
M12: = earlier and then now I’m agreeing to talk about it but I’m not I don’t really want to make a statement because I don’t know why I’m going to make a statement and then you book me into jail anyway just =
P1: = understand you don’t make a statement all we have is with the people who called what the original people told us and WE’RE JUST GOING TO GO OFF THAT that’s that’s =
P2: = and the scene and the evidence of the scene  =
P1: = that’s it that’s what you wanna do =
M12: = I haven’t hurt anybody =
P1: = okay =
P2: = but we have uh a different story of that and anyway what you’re saying that and that and that’s great you may not have maybe you could pick holes in their story it is up to you to give a statement = 
M12: = I’m not =
P2: = no you you even you’ve been on this side of the table I understand right you were in law enforcement you understand that I’m giving you this very straight I’m giving you a very fair shape of the deal it’s your decision a hundred percent if you want =
M12: = these guys that that they they treat me like a dirt bag they they put the handcuffs on me tighter than (.) uh you know what I mean it’s like I’m not a dirt bag I I was I’ve been cooperative in the entire time I follow the instructions I’ve been longer on =
P1: = at the end of the day you want to tell us your side of the story or you just want to go by what we heard 
(.)
M12: I I don’t know I mean I I thought I’d be better by if I (.) I don’t know what to do =
P2: = well I don’t know your attorney but I’d be damned if I’d let him lie on me without my side of the story =
M12: = he’s not gonna lie now =
P2: = I know that I’m been using an example hypothetically =
M12: = I I trust him for sure and I used to you know [ [inaudible]
P2: 										   [ I’ve been doing this job for 24 years I am NOT going to lie about a thing =
M12: = I don’t know that =
P2: = and that I’m not going to lie to you the deal is not =
M12: = am I going to jail or not ( I mean ) =
P1: = I don’t know yet you haven’t told us anything so at this point if you don’t tell us anything we can only go off of what we have =
P2: = sat waiting around =
M12: = what do you guys wanna know =
P2: = I want to know what happened he wants to know what happened right in the beginning from from what what the issue was that when your girlfriend ran out to the cab =
P1: = JUST START WHAT WERE YOU GUYS TALKING ABOUT LET’S START WITH THAT THAT’S WHAT SHE SAID SHE SAID YEAH WE DID GET INTO AN ARGUMENT =
P2: = mhm =

M12: = I’m not sure about that if I’m going to be invoking Miranda rights =
P2: = I see =
P1: = IT’S HARD TIME here’s the thing I mean you don’t say anything at all we have to go on what they told us (.) and that’s why you’re under arrest right now because of what they told us don’t wait you could try = 
M12: = so I am under arrest now =
P1: = yes that’s why I’ve ( read ) arrest ( warning ) to you =
M12: = I know I know (.) [inaudible] 
P1: but you saw it about the booking sheet =
M12: = I think =
P1: = I remember you are going to talk to us so all we have to go on is what they told us what it’s what the cab driver told us 
(.)
P2: what your girlfriend said what and then what we got to find out what was you said that’s all =
M12: = my girlfriend said that I did something so what’s the point of making a statement =
P1: = well listen =
P2: = y’all think a girl would lie you don’t think that uh somebody might lie that might not be the truth we might have evidence it doesn’t support what she says but we got to figure out what happened on your end or you can just be quiet it don’t matter to me Jordan but I do want the truth =
M12: = I I don’t want to I don’t want to I don’t want to be naïve to myself and say oh you know I mean yeah there was like 30 cars out there =
P1: = okay listen to this did you assault your girlfriend 
(.)
M12: was I =
