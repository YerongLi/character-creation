P1: hey what kind of knife was that =
F3: = it was like a kitchen knife =
P1: = was it just like somebody can get out of a like a butcher block kind of thing what does it look like can you describe it =
F3: = it just had a black handle on it and that it was that long =
P1: = and the serrated edge 
(.)
F3: yeah =
P1: = okay (.) when you had it with you did you have it in a car with you right and you drove to Javier’s house why did you have it with you =
F3: = because they were going to find my car and follow me she could have got me and kill me =
P1: = so are you are you telling me that you had it for some form of protection =
F3: = yeah because I know they’re gonna kill me I knew Josh’s family Josh had threatened me before Josh’s brother and had threatened me before =
P1: = did you have a gun or anything else =
F3: = no =
P1: = okay so that’s your form of protection (.) okay so when you got in the car tonight to go over to their house you had it in your hand or you brought it with you when you were arguing with Josh you had it is that right =
F3: = that was in my feet = 
P1: = okay and did they tell you to put it away =
F3: = they didn’t say anything =
P1: = Javier [inaudible] = 
F3: = no but Javier felt I had it and he said you really can think I told him so that if they really can see it they will leave me alone at one point it would just all go away =
P1: = right =
F3: = and he was like I can just ask Josh to come in I held the gun before =
P1: = mhm =
F3: = he said that it wasn’t I was so scared that I wasn’t going to do anything to them uh I just I was kind of ending the conversation and he said you know they’re not gonna stop at anything 
(.)
P1: okay 
(.)
F3: I had a knife out there hoping that she would just walk away from me and and see the things that I was actually going to do something and then they both came after me =
P1: = okay walk me through it you’re sitting there they pull up (.) Sarah gets out you go out to the street where she’s at (.) okay cause
(.)
F3: it was right in front of the car =
P1: = she’s right in front of the car okay (.) to the front of her car what happened when you encountered her =
F3: = she just started swinging at me and she also said that I wasn’t going to do anything and she realised that I had a knife and she kind of backed up and then she started swinging anyway so I just =
P1: = when you say she started swinging on you what was she doing =
F3: = she started patching me a bit =
P1: = crawling at you patching  =
F3: = yeah and then I saw Jenna coming out [ and
P1: 								   [ where were you holding the knife at the time =
F3: = at the time kind of to the side and then I saw Jennet coming at me and the other girl come around in the back end at the car =
P1: = mhm =
F3: = and they were all screaming at me and Jennet telling me that I’m crazy and that I wasn’t going to do anything and then like she said she wished I would stab her 
(.)
P1: who said that 
(.)
F3: um Jennet =
P1: = said I wished you stabbed me = 
F3: = yeah and said that I wish you stabbed me I wish you would and then um when Sarah was hitting me I went to hit and obviously I didn’t mean to stab her I’m not trying I’m going to kill somebody =
P1: = tell me how it happened =
F3: = she was hitting me and when I went to hit her back I had put one of my hands up and had like I tried to hit her back and keep my hands in front of me =
P1: = this is the knife show me how you were holding it =
F3: = I was holding it like that =
P1: = okay and now if I’m Sarah and I’m in front of you what were you doing with the knife how did you have it =
F3: = I had it on to the side and then she started swinging on me and I went I put my hand down and she was hitting on me and I was trying to defend myself from her and then Jennet came at me from the back = 
P1: = mhm =
F3: = and I guess like I did not mean to stab her at all =
P1: = how many times did you stab her =
F3: = I guess once =
P1: = okay you know where you hit her at =
F3: = I don’t know I didn’t see anything I had both of them coming at me and Sarah was hitting me to begin with =
P1: = okay (.) after you stabbed her did she go to the ground fall to the ground =
F3: = I didn’t see that I =
P1: = okay =
F3: = I was screaming at Jennet and after that she was screaming Jennet get in the car get quick and that’s all she would say and I didn’t see it (.) and I still heard her yelling her name calling her Jennet Jennet get in the car 
(.)
P1: okay (.) so (…) Sarah didn’t have any weapons with her alright she wasn’t carrying a gun or a knife that you saw right =
F3: = I don’t know =
P1: = okay a:nd you went out and you met her in in the street came up to her side of the car when she was getting out of it is that right =
F3: = it happened like in the front of my car yeah and she started screaming at me and then Jennet started coming out from the side so I walked over a little bit [ further and 
P1: 							    	    [ but initially it was just you and Sarah you said Jennet was in the back how your lip got hit =
F3: = I think Jennet did that I don’t know Sarah kind of hit me at the left side of my head ( it hurt ) more than anything =
P1: = okay =
F3: = and my stomach once but when Sarah was hitting me I saw Jennet come this way and the other girl got out of the other side of the car and walked around came back towards me =
P1: = okay so after that was done and you said you were being dragged around by Jennet and whatnot when you went back up to the house what did you do with the knife once you had it =
F3: = I threw it =
P1: = where =
F3: = to like towards Javier’s house =
P1: = if you’re facing Javier’s house to the left side or just in the grass or over the fence what =
F3: = I threw it up and I don’t know where it went = 
P1: up on a ROOF 
(.)
F3: I don’t know it was on a roof or a backyard or [inaudible] =
P1: = and how long you say the knife is =
F3: = it was about like that 
(…)
P1: um (…) then you went up and sat on the porch (…) and then took off 
(.)
F3: I saw them getting coming after me like followed me and followed me and kind of coming after me =
P1: = you stayed there then okay (…) do you know what my job is (.) hm what 
(.) 
F3: to take care of things like this to make sure that that they won’t happen =
P1: = well I understand that that’s I mean that’s overall police’s job but my specific job you know what it is =
F3: = getting out the details and everything =
P1: = well that’s part of it you’re correct my real title is okay is I’m a homicide detective okay they called me because of the serious nature of her (.) injuries okay she was stabbed (.) alright she was stabbed twice because before I came here to talk to you I went down and I saw her at the hospital okay she’s stabbed twice in the chest and she has no other injuries on her whatsoever (.) okay (…) what I need to know from you is is why I I understand that you had a knife because you thought you scare them okay but that isn’t working so why does somebody like you go one versus three you go out into the street I mean why didn’t you just run in the house and call the police =
F3: = I don’t know because I they came after me all the time but =
P1: = okay =
F3: = I don’t want to I wanted it =
P1: = so you wanted it to end and get it over with =
F3: = I had no intentions whatsoever on stabbing her I have a great life =
P1: = mhm =
F3: = I mean I have a job and I have my own house and I have my own credit everything and I just wanted it to end and that’s why I saw what I was done (.) and then I didn’t want them to come I really didn’t I was waiting I called my friend that I was with her earlier I told her to come over and pick me up =
P1: = mhm =
F3: = and she’s like oh you know you should really pick your car because if you don’t pick your car they’re going to do something to it and I said I don’t care =
P1: = mhm =
F3: = that’s just my car =
P1: = why did you change shirts =
F3: = I didn’t change shirts wait I had on my other shirt took off my ripped off shirt =
P1: = okay so that one got ripped off 
(.)
F3: yeah but I just did not want this to happen =
P1: = what kind of necklace you have is that yours =
F3: = yeah =
P1: = does that belong to you =
F3: = yeah 
(.)
P1: okay did you see if Sarah was wearing a necklace at that time = 
F3: = no I didn’t =
P1: = did you take anything from her =
F3: = no I did not there were rings in my front seat but I don’t think somebody mentioned that there were rings in my front seat in my car but I don’t remember being them in there =
P1: = okay =
F3: = I got in my car but I don’t know what she did 
(.)
P1: and so I’m clear I understand that Jennet was you know beating on you as well but initially it’s you and Sarah Javier dusting around in the street fighting with you guys at all =
F3: = no =
P1: = Josh wasn’t there =
F3: = yeah Josh was at home I heard Josh screaming like out at one point and when me and Sarah were done fighting Josh had called me and threatened me that he was going to come to me and shoot me with his gun =
P1: = why =
F3: = because of the fact that his sister called him and said that we were fighting and then I [ [inaudible]
P1: 						   [ his sister called him that you stabbed her =
F3: = I don’t know what she said to him I guess because she said that I hit her and that I found Sarah I don’t know what she said =
P1: = when everybody (.) this is what I’m having a problem you’re gonna have to help me out because when everybody got there Sarah is laying in the middle of the street with her stab wounds how did you not see that =
F3: = I didn’t get Jennet came after me like she physically came after me and dragged me around the front backyard =
P1: = mhm =
F3: = I didn’t see anything =
P1: = okay =
F3: = I just did it I didn’t feel like I saw Sarah sitting like on the edge of the seat in the front and she’s screaming at Jennet to get in the car and then after that Jennet just came after me she would not stop and Javier was dusting around like followed us trying to like I don’t know intimidate her maybe to leave me alone and she like I went down and once she knocked my phone out of my hands and she just kept drugging me around the front garden I couldn’t see anything =
P1: = I know you told me that you were upset and just wanted it to be over because they have been harassing you obviously was tonight kind of just the final straw is that what the deal was =
F3: = I just I want I didn’t want anything to do with any of them = 
P1: = mhm =
F3: = and it was him to call me when he =
P1: = but you brought a knife with you for a reason = 
F3: = I know because there were going to follow me [ [inaudible]
P1: 										 [ but you also said you had had enough of them when I asked you why you didn’t run into the house when they come pulling up a van and your response to me was what =
F3: = I don’t know I hate running and being scared I don’t want to hurt anybody I don’t like [ [inaudible]
P1: 						    [ [inaudible] okay and I know that but you did not = 
F3: = I had any intention on stabbing her 
(.)
P1: you had a knife in your hand how do you think that blade came in contact with her you said that she was like trying to hit you =
F3: = and I hit her back =
P1: = okay well how did you hit somebody with the knife in your hand you’re gonna have to show me so =
F3: = I was just screaming at her I just had it swinging at her and she kept hitting me and then started swinging back =
P1: = with the knife =
F3: = with both hands =
P1: = okay show me how you were you overhand or like this or what =
F3: = everywhere like =
P1: = all over =
F3: = because that’s all she was doing to me both of them and the other girl coming after me 
(.)
P1: okay I see (.) did you um did you have Jennet call = 
P2: = mhm =
(( F3 sobs ))
P1: = okay (…) here the next things is that you need to that you need to understand Rachel okay when I was down at the hospital okay I saw where she was stabbed at okay it looks like she had two stab wounds alright the next piece of information that you need to know is that she is dead 
(…)
(( F3 cries loud )) 
F3: oh my god 
(…)
P1: okay and she died at the result of these stab wounds that she had at Northside Hospital 
(…)
F3: I didn’t know I just wanted it stop I just wanted them to finally leave me alone =
P1: = all this over Josh =
F3: = I just didn’t want them to terrorise me anymore they follow me everywhere they come to my job they come to my house they did not =
P1: = she’s not gonna follow you anymore because she’s dead now 
(…)
F3: oh my god (…) I just wanted it over you know every time I call the cops they don’t do anything they don’t they tell me they want a physical proof of them injuring me or something 
(.)
P1: well here’s here’s the deal we have to work with what the law says and I understand the frustration
